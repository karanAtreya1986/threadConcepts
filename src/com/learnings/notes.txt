Thread states –
New  - create instance of thread class. Thread t1=new thread();
Runnable - <threadname>.start – then it becomes runnable.
Running – thread scheduler has picked thread for running.
Not runnable or blocked. – thread not eligible yet to run. 
Terminated. – run method is completed, so work over.

Thread scheduler – for picking up the threads to run.
Which thread should run.
Two methodologies-
Preemptive
And time slicing.
Preemptive – picks thread with highest priority.
Time slicing- task runs for specific time and comes back to pool of task.
